# CS121-Assignment3-M1
Inverted index for assignment 3.

# ** developer.zip is too big to add here, but is on the assignment page in canvas. Just add to main directory.

# Deliverables: 
Submit a report (pdf) with a table with the following numbers pertaining to your index. 

It should have, at least: 

 - the number of indexed documents

 - the number of [unique] words 

 - the total size (in KB) of your index on disk.

No late submissions will be accepted for this milestone.

# Evaluation criteria:

Did your report show up on time?

Are the reported numbers plausible?
